### “Variable Fonts represent an opportunity to reinvent the relationship between me, the type designer, and my user ... we work together to make typography.”

<!-- class: quote

### “...The writer would be working closer to the nature of the multiplied result, and through an increasing awareness and gradual mastery of the form’s new limitations and possibilities *the writing itself would evolve;* the shorter the distance between the raw material of words and their processed output, the more entwined the content and form from the outset. ”

class: quote

### “I evoke the term ‘handmade web’ to suggest slowness and smallness as a forms of resistance. In today’s highly commercialised web of multinational corporations, proprietary applications, read-only devices, search algorithms, Content Management Systems, WYSIWYG editors, and digital publishers, it becomes an increasingly radical act to hand-code and self-publish experimental web art and writing projects.”

In this context, the long-term view is as seductive as the apolitical, inward turn of the communards from the nineteen-sixties.
